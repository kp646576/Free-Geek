        <h2>What You Get</h2>
        <h3>The Feel Good Benefits</h3>
        <p> It always feels good to volunteer. When you volunteer at Free Geek you are putting thousands of computers into the hands of local school children, non-profits and community members and keeping thousands of tons of electronic waste out of the landfills. You take part in bridging the digital divide while meeting wonderful people. You can increase technology access and education by taking part in decisions at Free Geek, from the most basic to the most wide-reaching and abstract.</p>
