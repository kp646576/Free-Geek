                <p>An internship at Free Geek is an excellent opportunity to gain valuable job skills, make a difference for people and the environment, and make connections in the community. Each internship lasts between 3 to 6 months, with options to renew afterwards. Due to the nature of these volunteer activities, we ask that applicants be at least 16 years of age or older.
                </p>
                <p>Active interns receive a 20% discount on items in the Free Geek Thrift Store and are eligible to become a member of the First Tech Credit Union. Free Geek also offers free computer classes to volunteers. In addition, interns can choose to receive a free computer after volunteering 24 hours in our internship program.</p>
