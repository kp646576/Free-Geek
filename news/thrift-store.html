        <p>Not only can you find an amazing selection of reused computers, laptops and electronics in the <a href="http://www.freegeek.org/thrift-store/" title="Cheap computers, electronics and more in the thrift store">Free Geek Thrift Store</a>, we also <a href="http://www.freegeek.org/thrift-store/free-geek-online-sales/" title="Free Geek Online Sales">sell items online</a> through <a title="Free Geek sale items on eBay" href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/freegeek_portland/m.html">eBay</a> and <a title="Ink, toner and more on Free Geek Amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/shops/free_geek">Amazon</a>!</p>
        <p>Our <a title="Free Geek sale items on eBay" href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/freegeek_portland/m.html">Ebay storefront</a> includes many items you won’t find in our thrift store including assorted A/V equipment, higher-end refurbished and reused electronics and a whole lot more. You can find a wide assortment of inks and toners on our <a title="Ink, toner and more on Free Geek Amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/shops/free_geek">Amazon storefront</a> as well as various other items. These online storefronts promise competitive pricing <strong>and</strong> you can feel good knowing that all of your purchases support the Free Geek mission and protect the environment through reuse. Our product lineup is constantly changing, so check back often.</p>
        <p>The items you find in the online storefront are reserved for online buyers and must be purchased online; we may not have the same or similar items in our store. If you’d like to save on shipping costs, though, we do provide pickup options for our Ebay storefront (not Amazon, sorry). Just make it clear you would prefer to pickup when making your purchase.</p>
