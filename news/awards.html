        <p>Thank you for voting us the #1 local nonprofit using technology in outstanding ways as part of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pdxtech4good">PDXTech4Good’s</a> <a href="http://www.meetup.com/pdxtech4good-nonprofit-activist-tech/events/142588172/">Thanks4Good event</a>! We were excited to learn more about other top-nominated organizations including &nbsp;<a id="js_29" href="https://www.facebook.com/AppCampForGirls">App Camp For Girls</a>, &nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Autism-Service-Dogs-of-America/168559208675">Autism Service Dogs of America</a>, &nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/StreetRoots">Street Roots</a>, and &nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/AlohaLibrary">Aloha Community Library Association</a> at their November 6th information session and awards ceremony. While PDXTech4Good initially planned to give all funds raised to Free Geek, we announced we’re going to share portions of the donations with the #2 and #3 spots, Autism Service Dogs of America and App Camp for Girls. There’s still time for you to donate to these three amazing local organizations.
