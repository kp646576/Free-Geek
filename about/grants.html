                <h3>Hardware Grants</h3>
                <p>The Hardware Grants Program connects qualifying non-profits with needed and available refurbished computer equipment. Since our inception in February 2000, we have granted out more than <strong>10,500</strong> PCs and many other technology items to various organizations. Read on for more details.</p>
                <h3>Eligibility Criteria</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Must be a 501c(3) non-profit organization, be under fiscal sponsorship of a non-profit, or be affiliated with a government agency</li>
                    <li>Must be able to pick up the hardware in person from Free Geek&#8217;s office in <a href="/about/directions">Portland, Oregon</a>.</li>
                    <li>Must dispose of the hardware in an environmentally responsible manner when it has reached the end of its lifecycle.</li>
                    <li>Must not currently be in our grants queue and waiting for a hardware grant from Free Geek.</li>
                    <li>Must not have received granted hardware from Free Geek in the past <strong>90 days</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Applicants requesting iMacs and laptops must be located within the Portland city limits.</li>
                    <li><strong>Individuals are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> eligible for grants.</strong> Please review our <a href="http://www.freegeek.org/#volunteer">volunteer opportunities</a> for earning a desktop.</li>
                    <li>We rarely make grants to international organizations due to difficulty in verifying the organizationâ€™s status, and responsible recycling when the equipment becomes obsolete. Check out the <a href="http://www.worldcomputerexchange.org/">World Computer Exchange</a> for international alternatives.</li>
                    <li>We ask that grant recipients cultivate a positive relationship with Free Geek, including posting about grants received on your newsletters and social media, to help raise awareness about our Grants program.</li>

                <h3>What we grant</h3>
                <p>Free Geek makes <strong>in-kind grants</strong> of refurbished electronic equipment. We primarily grant complete PC systems which come installed with <a href="http://linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a> as an operating system. These systems are excellent for typical office tasks, such as word processing and browsing the web. All systems come with monitor, mouse, keyboard, and power cables. We can often provide grants of other hardware, please be specific about the type and number of items you need.</p>
                <p>The computer hardware that we grant is used and come to us via <a href="http://www.freegeek.org/donate/what-we-take/">donations</a> made by individuals and organizations in our community. It is then tested and built by our staff and volunteers. Most granted hardware comes with a one-year warranty for <a href="http://www.freegeek.org/about/techsupport/">technical support</a>, provided there have been no major hardware or software changes to the system.</p>
                <h3>Things that have changed:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>We have recently limited the quantities of PCs, laptops, and Mac desktop computers available per grant application.</li>
                    <li>We expect that the quantities available per grant application will change seasonally with the number of donations and volunteers that help us build computers.</li>
                    <li>We are not able to provide information about what future quantities will be, as it fluctuates depending on a variety of factors that we cannot predict.</li>
                    <li><strong>We can no longer grant non-functioning or untested equipment</strong> (such as computer parts for display in a computer class), in order to comply with pending <a href="http://www.sustainableelectronics.org/">R2 certification</a> requirements.</li>
                    <br />
