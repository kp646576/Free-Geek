                <h3>What We&#8217;ll Do</h3>
                <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">We </span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">provide tech support for all </span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">adopted and granted systems for one-year after the date the system was received, provided there have been no major hardware changes to the system. </span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In addition, s</span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">ystems purchased in the store include a six-month hardware warranty. </span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Is your system out of warranty? No problem. S</span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">upport for systems out of warranty is $15 plus the cost of parts, provided for one-year after the warranty ends.</span></p>
                <p>In addition to system warranties, our Tech Support team can also backup and transfer your data from about-to-be-donated items before you hand them over. There is a $20 fee for this service and additional fees may apply if you require a storage device for your data. Recently we also started installing Linux Mint 17 on non-Free Geek system for a $40 fee.</p>
                <h3>When We Can Do It</h3>
                <p>Free Geek tech support is available on <strong>Tuesdays through Saturdays from 12 PM to 5.45 PM</strong>.</p>

                        <li>Call (503)232-9350 and press option 6. If your call is not answered (you call outside of tech support hours, or the support techs are busy) please leave a message with your name, phone number, and a short description of your problem. We will get back to you as soon as we have finished helping other customers.</li>
                        <li>Send an email to <a href="mailto:support@freegeek.org">our Tech Support team (support at freegeek dot org)</a>. Be sure to include contact information and a short description of what is not working properly.</li>
