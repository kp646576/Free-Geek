        <h3>What We Take</h3>
        <p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-169" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/img_1266-199x300.jpg" alt="We accept computers and electronics in any condition." width="189" height="285" srcset="http://www.freegeek.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/img_1266-199x300.jpg 199w, http://www.freegeek.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/img_1266-99x150.jpg 99w, http://www.freegeek.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/img_1266.jpg 531w" sizes="(max-width: 189px) 100vw, 189px">Free Geek accepts nearly everything that plugs into a computer or uses electricity (including smart phones, tablets, e-readers, video game systems and any old gadget you can think of) whether or not it’s in working condition. We are happy to accept your printers (including extra ink and toner), scanners, routers, UPS, digital cameras, PDAs, cell phones, and a whole lot more! In fact, it’s almost easier to tell you <a href="#We_DO_NOT_Accept:">what we definitely don’t accept</a>.</p>
        <p>Free Geek proudly participates in the <a href="http://www.oregonecycles.org">Oregon E-Cycles</a> program which offers free and convenient recycling of computers, monitors, and televisions for all Oregonians. If you have more than 7 of these items, please call ahead to determine if we will accept the additional computers, monitors, or televisions for free. Also, if you will be bringing in pallet-loads of equipment (or a U-Haul full), please call ahead to set up an appointment and verify what we are able to accept free of charge.</p>
        <p><strong>Do you have a large palletized drop-off to make?</strong> We can do that, just&nbsp;email us first at <a href="mailto:incoming@freegeek.org" target="_blank">incoming@freegeek.org</a>&nbsp;(this email is for large palletized donations only, other inquiries can be directed to info@freegeek.org) and schedule a time, so that we can serve you most efficiently and smoothly. We are a small nonprofit and can only handle so much material per week.</p>
        <p>Free Geek has suggested monetary donation amounts for individual pieces of hardware. These funds support our volunteer programs, <a title="Free computer-based classes" href="{{ site.url }}/about/classes">free classes</a> for the community, and <a title="Hardware Grants for non-profits and schools" href="{{ site.url }}/about/grants">grants of equipment</a> to non-profits, schools and community change organizations! As a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization, equipment and monetary donations to Free Geek are tax deductible.</p>

        <h3>Recycling software and manuals:</h3>
        <p>We accept all software, manuals, and cables for donation. While we can’t promise we’ll use them all, we do recycle them responsibly if we can’t make use of them.
            <a name="Extra_Credit:"></a>
        </p>
        <h3>What to expect:</h3>
        <p>When you arrive we’ll take your hardware donations through the door marked “Donations Drop.” We’ve got carts and muscle to help you if you need it, just let us know. From there you be given a slip to take over to our Front Desk for processing. We’ll ask you for some donation tracking information and the suggested monetary donation. You’ll get a tax receipt plus lots of appreciation and be on your way. The whole process takes about 5-10 minutes depending on the size of your donation.</p>
        <h3>Extra Credit:</h3>
        <p>Recycling computers is labor intensive. Doing any of the following to prepare your equipment for donation will help us speed the processing and recycling of your equipment.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Untangle all cords and cables. Coil them up with a rubber band or twist tie.</li>
            <li>Attach power adapters (AC adaptors, transformers) to their associated equipment (such as powered speakers, printers or routers) as best you can.

            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Please do not leave donations outside of business hours or without going through our donation process with Staff. DUMPING IS ILLEGAL and puts your personal data at risk.</h3>
