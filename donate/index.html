        <h3>Free Geek is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, so you know that your donations go right back to the community!</h3>
        <div class="large-6 columns">
            <p>Access to information has become a basic need in the 21st century. Without it, a person is at serious disadvantage competing for livable-wage jobs. Your donation helps thousands of Free Geek volunteers get computer technology into the hands of people who need it including the disadvantaged, schools, non-profits, and other community change organizations. Donations also help pay for free classes, tech support, and volunteer programs to ensure that everyone in the greater Portland community has access to a strong base of computer user skills.
