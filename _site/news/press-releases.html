        <h3>Two Portland Non-Profits Set to Complete Major Computer Project</h3>
        <h4>200 Refurbished Computers Being Donated to Portland Public Schools</h4>
        <p>Portland, Oregon March 5, 2013 Free Geek and Portland YouthBuilders (PYB) announced today that they are near completion of a project to refurbish 200 desktop computers donated by the City of Portland that are being distributed to various Portland public schools.</p>
        <p>Through the City of Portland, 200 computers are being donated to Free Geek, who will train volunteers to test the machines and prepare them for refurbishment by students enrolled in Portland YouthBuilders Youth Media Program. As a licensed Microsoft Windows refurbisher, PYB will install RAM and hard drives on the Dell Optiplex 960 systems. â€œSince 2008, the City has been sending its used computers to Free Geek for precisely this type of collaboration: getting quality machines into the hands of students and non-profit organizations, said Portland City Commissioner Dan Saltzman who created the program.</p>
        <p>To date, more than 140 computers have been refurbished and placed in schools across PPS including 35 at West Sylvan Middle School. â€œI had the joy of watching an entire class working with no technical difficulties, no frozen screens. Pure heaven for all, said Susan Scanlon, West Sylvan library assistant and technology coordinator. Portland Public Schools has over 85 schools, many with obsolete equipment in their computer labs,â€ added Tony Magliano, deputy chief operating officer for the school district. â€œThis donation will inject new life into technology labs at nine schools. We are truly grateful to Free Geek and Portland YouthBuilders for this contribution to student learning.</p>
        <p>For Portland YouthBuilder students, all of whom are also AmeriCorps members, â€œthe refurbishment effort represents PYB's focus on vocational training and service to the community. We are delighted to be able to give our young people the opportunity to support Portland schools in a very tangible way, said PYB's Executive Director Jill Walters.</p>
        <p>Darren Heiber, Free Geek&#8217;s Director of Public Services, said he is, &#8220;overjoyed to experience this collaboration with Portland YouthBuilders, impacting so many students in the Portland area. Not only do we provide greater access to environmentally-responsible refurbished technology in the PPS classrooms, students in the Portland YouthBuilders&#8217; Youth Media program also get to strengthen their computer refurbishment skills.&#8221;</p>

        <p><em>About Free Geek</em>
            <br /> FREE GEEK (www.freegeek.org) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit that recycles technology and provides access to computers, the Internet, education and job skills in exchange for community service. We accept donations from the public of most electronic equipment, ranging from computers and printers to stereos, tablets, smartphones, iPods and other mp3 players. Free Geek benefits from a dedicated group of 500 to 600 active volunteers each month. Our volunteers evaluate, test and disassemble various components, which are either ethically recycled to reclaim useful materials or incorporated into refurbished systems loaded with Free and Open Source Software. There are multiple ways volunteers can receive a free computer in exchange for their community service. Many opt for the 24 hour adoption program, others learn to refurbish computers through the build program, and K-12 Portland students are able to volunteer for 24 hours in their communities to earn a free computer via the Plug Into Portland program. We also offer a variety of free classes, open to the public, on a range of topics from building job skills and navigating the Internet, to the use of free and open source software and programming skills. Computer hardware that does not go to Free Geek&#8217;s volunteers is granted out to schools, nonprofits and other community change organizations through our Hardware Grants program or sold online and in our thrift store to members of the wider community.</p>
