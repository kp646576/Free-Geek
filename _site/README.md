# Free Geek Website Prototype
---
### About
This is a prototype website for the non-profit organization Free Geek hosted on GitHub Pages [here](http://kp646576.github.io/Free-Geek-Prototype) as a way to see what the [original website](http://www.freegeek.org/) would look like if the front page design was extended to additional pages.

## Motivation
One day while browsing Free Geek's website I had noticed that their main page had been updated to a more modern design. I loved the new design, but noticed that the other pages on their website had yet to be updated. As a previous Free Geek volunteer, I thought that this would be a great opportunity to help the organization by developing a prototype of an updated website to show the Free Geek staff and volunteer to assist in updating their website.
